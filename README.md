# OmniTalk 🛡️
**Privacy-First, Offline-Native Translation Engine**

## 🚀 Hackathon Mission
Built for the 2026 Hackathon, OmniTalk focuses on two non-negotiable pillars:
1. **No Internet Dependency:** Functional in remote zones, airplanes, and disaster areas.
2. **Total Data Privacy:** 0% data egress. All processing happens on-device.

## 🛠️ Project Structure
- **lib/main.dart**: Features a unique 180° inverted split-screen UI for natural face-to-face communication.
- **lib/ai_service.dart**: Implements the Modular Adapter Switching pattern for "Any-to-Any" offline translation.
- **pubspec.yaml**: Standard Flutter configuration.

## 🧠 Technical Vision
OmniTalk utilizes on-device LLM inference (simulated via WASM logic in this prototype) to ensure that sensitive voice data never leaves the user's hardware. This solves the "Cloud Trust" issue prevalent in modern translation tools.
